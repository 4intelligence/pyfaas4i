## forecastpack.forecast


In order to access the forecast pack using Python, you need to have R installed in your machine, as well as the the following R packages: dplyr, jsonlite, lmtest, randomForest, glment and caret.

If you are using Windows, you first need to make sure that the path of R is in your Environment Variables, which can be done with:
- Go to your 'Control Panel';
- Enter environment in the search box and press enter;
- Click 'Edit the system environment variables';
- In the 'Advanced' tab click 'Environment Variables';
- Under 'User variables' double click 'PATH';
- Check if the pack to R is listed, if not add your path. Should be something like "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.2\bin\x64". You might have an issue with the space between 'Program Files', in such case you can replace it with "C:\Progra~1\R\R-4.3.2\bin\x64";
- Click 'OK' until all windows have been closed;
- Restart your machine and you should be able to access your forecast pack.

Then you are good to go and should be able to extract relevant information about your model. For examples of usage, refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/4intelligence/pyfaas4i/blob/main/docs/forecastpack.md).

# Auxiliary function

## forecastpack.install_R_packages(cran_mirror)
**function <span style="color:orange">install_R_packages</span>()**
Function that will install the following required R packages to use the *from_rds* method of the **forecast** class.

By default packages are installed from "http://cran.us.r-project.org", but you can change to a CRAN mirror of your preference.

# **class <span style="color:orange">forecast</span>()**:
Object that contains all properties of a forecastpack generated by 4intelligence's Forecast as a Service (FAAS)

|*Attributes*| |
|---|-----|
| **json**| json version of the forecastpack|
| **type**| type of the selected model|
| **sample**| sample of the in_sample data from the selected model|
| **transformation**| transformation done in the selected model's data|
| **RMSE**| The root mean squared error for all windows of the cross-validation for the selected model|
| **RMSE_list**| The root mean squared errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model|
| **MPE**| The mean percentage error for all windows of the cross-validation for the selected model|
| **MPE_list**| The mean percentage errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model|
| **MAPE**| The mean absolute percentage error for all windows of the cross|validation for the selected model|
| **MAPE_list**| The mean absolute percentage errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model
| **WMAPE**| The weighted mean absolute percentage error for all windows of the cross|validation for the selected model
| **WMAPE_list**| The weighted mean absolute percentage errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model
| **MASE**| The mean absolute scaled error compares the model's accuracy to a baseline model. It is scale-independent: 1 indicating that the model performs equally, while a value less than 1 means that it outperforms the baseline|
| **MASEs**| The seasonal mean absolute scaled error compares the model's accuracy to a seasonal baseline model. It is scale-independent: 1 indicating that the model performs equally, while a value less than 1 means thatn it outperforms the seasonal baseline|
| **models**| Properties of the chosen model, based on the model type (see [example](https://github.com/4intelligence/pyfaas4i/blob/main/docs/forecastpack.md))|
| **infos**| Information regarding the chosen model, based on the model type|
| **data**| Dataframe containing the training data used in the selected model|
| **data_proj**| Dataframe containing the data used for forecasting|
| **forecast**| Dataframe containing the entire time series, with historical and forecasted data|



*Note that attributes will refer to a selected model (default is the first model of the forecast pack).*



|**Methods**| |
|---|---------|
|**set_model**(model_number, simplify, verbose) | Changes the model from which the properties will be taken|
|**from_rds**(path, raw, simplify)| Fills the forecast() object properties according to data from a forecastpack rds file. |
|**from_json**(path, raw, simplify)| Fills the forecast() object properties according to data from a forecastpack json file.|
|**describe**(summarise=True)| Creates a summary dataframe with data from all the models inside the forecastpack.|
|**model_list**(n_best, metric)| Outputs a list with the best models based on informed criteria and number of models desired.
