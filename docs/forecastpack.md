| **sample**| sample of the in_sample data from the selected model|
| **transformation**| transformation done in the selected model's data|
| **RMSE**| The root mean squared error for all windows of the cross-validation for the selected model|
| **RMSE_list**| The root mean squared errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model|
| **MPE**| The mean percentage error for all windows of the cross-validation for the selected model|
| **MPE_list**| The mean percentage errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model|
| **MAPE**| The mean absolute percentage error for all windows of the cross|validation for the selected model|
| **MAPE_list**| The mean absolute percentage errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model
| **WMAPE**| The weighted mean absolute percentage error for all windows of the cross|validation for the selected model
| **WMAPE_list**| The weighted mean absolute percentage errors for each window of the cross validation for the selected model
| **models**| Properties of the chosen model, based on the model type (see [example](https://github.com/4intelligence/pyfaas4i/blob/main/forecastpack_example.ipynb))|

| **data_proj**| Dataframe containing the data used for forecasting|
| **forecast**| Dataframe containing the entire time series, with historical and forecasted data|



*Note that attributes will refer to a selected model (default is the first model of the forecast pack).*




|**Methods**| |
|---|---------|
|**set_model**(model_number, simplify, verbose) | Changes the model from which the properties will be taken|
|**from_rds**(path, raw, simplify)| Fills the forecast() object properties according to data from a forecastpack rds file. |
|**from_json**(path, raw, simplify)| Fills the forecast() object properties according to data from a forecastpack json file.|
|**describe**(summarise=True)| Creates a summary dataframe with data from all the models inside the forecastpack.|
|**model_list**(n_best, metric)| Outputs a list with the best models based on informed criteria and number of models desired.
